## Slide-by-Slide Content

### SLIDE 1: Cover — Hardwiring the Abraham Accords

**Title:** ALIGN Intelligence
**Headline:** Hardwiring the Abraham Accords.

ALIGN Intelligence operates as an intelligence-driven origination engine and IMEC Unified Operation Center. We aim to serve Sovereign Wealth Funds, DFIs, and strategic General Partners seeking proprietary, de-risked exposure to the India–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor. Serving as the infrastructure of the future of the region's infrastructure.

The Abraham Accords provided the diplomatic license. IMEC provides the physical footprint.

But diplomacy is software — elegant, essential, yet vulnerable to the next election cycle or geopolitical shock. To make regional stability irreversible, we must upgrade to hardware. By weaving together power grids, desalinated water pipelines, and subsea data cables, we create structural interdependence — a web of mutual reliance so deep that conflict becomes economically irrational.

To build this, we need a living organism:
- **The Skeleton** — Physical Infrastructure: Ports, railways, energy lines, pipelines — the frame
- **The Nervous System** — ALIGN Intelligence: Real-time sensing of risks and opportunities — AI agents and human networks transmitting signals 24/7
- **The Muscle** — Economic Execution: Consortiums, SPVs, and financial models translating intelligence into construction on the ground

Built for execution. Intelligence-driven. Shaping the 21st century.
